# Stretch Goals and Future Improvements
I will continue to work on this website as it was not what I ended up wanting. I will have users be able to login and logout without any problem and have users create their profile and customize it to however they'd like to.

As for some goals that I planned for future development I planned to:
* Have users add their credentials in order to buy the items that they want.
* Use a third-party payment gateway to have the funds transferred into the sellers account.
* Implement a commission-based system.

Although I was not able to get the project looking and/or working as intended, I still had fun in the process of learning a new language. Being able to creat API's and Authentication is all located in the the Microsoft Documentation and I was able to grasp the concept in a short amount of time. 

I am glad to have worked on this project and I will definitely do some changes moving forward.
